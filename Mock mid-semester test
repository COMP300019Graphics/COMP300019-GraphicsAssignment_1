Mock mid-semester test

This is a sample of the kind of questions to expect on the mid-semester test. 


Reading + Writing Time: 40 minutes
Number of Questions/Grading Scheme: 2 questions worth equal marks.
Authorised Materials: None

Question 1: Database Design

a) Draw a Conceptual Model (ER / EER) for the following scenario (X marks).
FirstChoice Lawn Mower Rental’s business environment is centered around its mowers. A manufacturer manufactured at least one and generally many of FirstChoice’s mowers. FirstChoice would like to maintain the details of the mowers they own and the manufacturers of their mowers. Details of mowers include engine number, year manufactured, make and model, while details of the manufacturers include name, contact person, phone number and location.

A mower has had many maintenance events, but a brand new mower has not had any yet. Details of the maintenance of each mower are also maintained including the date and total cost. A mower may not have been rented to any customers or may have been rented to many customers. A customer may have rented many mowers from FirstChoice and to be in FirstChoice’s business environment must have rented at least one. FirstChoice Lawn Mower Rental maintains the details about rental date, return date and cost of rental for each customer for each mower they rented. In addition, it keeps the details of their customers including their name, address, contact number and driver’s license number.

ASSUMPTIONS, COMMENTS, EXPLANATIONS (X marks based on statement appropriateness)
