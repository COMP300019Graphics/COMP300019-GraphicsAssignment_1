1. - Try to be familiar with the basic operations, 
     I'm currently trying to finish the sync setting. Let me know if you know how to it.


Part2 - Tasks
1. 
Randomly seeded fractal landscape;
- 	Write Diamond-Square Algorithm in landscape.cs to generate the “title” effect, using Direct3D for drawing;

Procedures:
a. Project setup:
Decide deleting useless staff in “landscape.cs”; 
Display a 4-polygon to the screen;
Adjust camera orientation so that the landscape plane is seeable, a simple 4-polygon in 3D view; 
->
b. Generate 2D matrix: Methods Initialization and testing 
void Initialize_2dArray( int dimension); 
void Diamond(), 
void Square(), 
float Random( float min, float max); 
void SetHeight(float height); 
float GetHeight();
->
c. Vertex mapping from 2D Matrix:
Add new vertex definition for generated vertex values from the 2D matrix;


2. 
Camera Motion: “camera.cs”
- Camera rotation (mouse), translation (movement: keyboard WASD, QE)
Apply view space to render all objects in a common(consistent) World View; (unlikely in project1, just one object being rendered)
Apply transformation matrix: translation, scale, rotation matrix, in accordance with user’s inputs (3-4 different 
matrices used here, free available online);

*Refer to youtube, lab 4 camera.cs, online documentation to get the basic ideas*
