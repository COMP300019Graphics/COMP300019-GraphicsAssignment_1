1. Randomly seeded fractal landscape;
- 	Write Diamond-Square Algorithm in landscape.cs to generate the “title” effect, using Direct3D for drawing;

#Generate 2D matrix: Methods Initialization and testing 
void Diamond(), 
void Square(), 
float Random( float min, float max); 
void SetHeight(float height); 
float GetHeight();

#Vertex mapping from 2D Matrix:
Add new vertex definition for generated vertex values from the 2D matrix;


2. Camera Motion: “camera.cs”
- Camera rotation (mouse), translation (movement: keyboard WASD, QE)

Apply view space to render all objects in a common(consistent) World View; (unlikely in project1, just one object being rendered)
Apply transformation matrix: translation, scale, rotation matrix, in accordance with user’s inputs (3-4 different 
matrices used here);
